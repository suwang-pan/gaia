    A processing unit represents anything that can compute. It can be a Docker
    container or a simple UNIX process. Processing units are created, updated, and
    deleted by
    the system as they come and go. You can only modify their tags. Processing units
    use network policies to define which other processing units or external
    networks they can communicate with and file access policies to define what file
    paths they can use.

      The local PUID set by enforcer. Enforcer may create a local PU if it cannot
      communicate with the Microsegmentation Console. When eventually the
      Microsegmentation Console is able to create the PU, the `clientLocalID` will be
      used to convert a CachedFlowReport containing a local PUID to a real FlowReport.

  - name: datapathType
    description: |-
      The datapath type that processing units are implementing:
      - `Aporeto`: The enforcer is managing and handling the datapath.
      - `EnvoyAuthorizer`: The enforcer is serving Envoy-compatible gRPC APIs
      that for example can be used by an Envoy proxy to use the Microsegmentation PKI
      and implement Microsegmentation network policies. NOTE: The enforcer is not
      owning the datapath in this case. It is merely providing an authorizer API.
