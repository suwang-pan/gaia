# NamespaceMappingPolicy

> Operations: `GET` `UPDATE` `DELETE`

A Namespace Mapping Policy defines in which namespace a Processing Unit should
be placed when it is created, based on its tags.

When an Aporeto Agent creates a new Processing Unit, the system will place it in
its own namespace if no matching Namespace Mapping Policy can be found. If one
match is found, then the Processing will be bumped down to the namespace
declared in the policy. If it finds in that child namespace another matching
Namespace Mapping Policy, then the Processing Unit will be bumped down again,
until it reach a namespace with no matching policies.

This is very useful to dispatch processes and containers into a particular
namespace, based on a lot of factor.

You can put in place a quarantine namespace that will grab all Processing Units
with too much vulnerabilities for instances.
